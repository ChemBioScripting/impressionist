# Impressionist

Impressionist is a prototype and concept to build a visual (wysiwyg) editor for creating impress.js
presentations. The idea is to use the browser and impress.js itself, and simply add edit mode and
navigation in 3D space on top.

Currently this is a work in progress, not yet useable. Current work is focused on viewing impress.js
presentations in a 3D "camera". There is no support to actually edit anything.

You can try the demo at

    > firefox templates/official-demo/index.html

To use this for your own presentations, you can hook in impressionist with 2 simple tags:

    <link href="path-to-impressionist-repo/css/impressionist.css" rel="stylesheet" />
    <script src="path-to-impressionist-repo/js/impressionist.js"></script>
